The Illustris Simulation: Public Data Release

Example code (Python).

See the [Illustris Website Data Access Page](http://www.illustris-project.org/data/) for details.

This is my modified version. Currently only sublink.py is modified for finding mass ratio of mergers at t_max plus other info.
Please cite [this paper](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/525/1/577/7231831) in addition to the [TNG papaers](https://www.tng-project.org/results/) if you find this code useful.

My modifications are based on [this discussion](https://www.tng-project.org/data/forum/topic/662/nummerger-in-sublink/).
